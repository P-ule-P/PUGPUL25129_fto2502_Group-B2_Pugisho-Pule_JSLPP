## Project Description 🧾

A simple, JavaScript-driven Kanban board tailored for monitoring career growth milestones. It presents tasks in a clear visual layout across three workflow stages—🔵 TODO, 🟣 DOING, and 🟢 DONE—using interactive cards and a modal-based editing system. Built with vanilla JavaScript, it features local storage persistence, form validation, and a mobile-responsive design without external dependencies.
